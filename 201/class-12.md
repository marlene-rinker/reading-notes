### Chart JS

[Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js](https://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/11/easily-create-stunning-animated-charts-with-chart-js/)

Charts are a great way to display data. They are easier to look at than tables.

Chart.js is a JavaScript plug-in that makes creating charts easier.

Download Chart.js and put it in your project folder. Then link to it in your HTML file (in the head of your html).

Use the `<canvas>` element in HTML to hold your chart. Use chart.js to draw the cart in the `<canvas>` element.

This article has good examples for drawing three types of charts:

- line chart

- bar chart

- pie chart

[Basic Usage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API/Tutorial/Basic_usage)

`<canvas>` can be styled like any other element. However, the `<canvas>` styles don't affect the drawings inside `<canvas>`.

When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.

Tip: If your renderings seem distorted, try specifying your width and height attributes explicitly in the `<canvas>` attributes, and not using CSS.

The article has a simple example included.
