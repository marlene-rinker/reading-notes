#### Routing

Using `react-router`, you can easily toggle the visibility of components (or even pages) based on the URL/Route that the user engages with.

`import { Route } from 'react-router-dom';`

To use Browser Router properly, you eliminate your use of `<a>` tags and instead use itâ€™s built-in `<Link>` component.

Example:

```
<Link to="/">Home</Link>
<Link to="/stuff">Stuff</Link>
```
In practice, then, use the router component to look at either `/` or `/stuff` and based on that, displaying either the `Home` or the `List` component.

```
<Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
 <Route exact path="/stuff" render={() => <List>{items}</List>} />
 ```

 **Component Composition - Logical**

 In this setup, you are sending your child components the raw data and allowing them to render the output as they decide.

 **Component Composition - Using Logic-less Children**

 This is typically used when your children are already in JSX form (pre-rendered) and you need to display them as a whole. A good example might be a gallery of images.

 [Today's Article](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-29/DISCUSSION) has examples for logical and logic-less children component composition.
