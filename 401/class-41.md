### React Native

[React Native](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-41/DISCUSSION)

React Native is used to create apps for Android and iOS using React.

React Native is still just state and components. There's no HTML or CSS. You can still style things using the framework guidelines.

**Expo**: the dev environment

**Snack**: an online sandbox

**expo-cli**: the local equivalent to create-react-app

When running locally, you can use your own device or the official simulator.

- only Apple users can test iPhones
- anyone can test android, but you have to start up an ADB from The Android Studio IDE
