#### Solving Problems

[How to Solve Programming Problems](https://simpleprogrammer.com/solving-problems-breaking-it-down/)

**Common Mistakes**

- improper allocation of time
- trying to start writing code as soon as possible
- trying to oversolve the problem on the first try

**Simple Steps to Follow**

1. Read the problem completely at least twice. Make sure you can explain it to someone else.
2. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data. Nothing can be automated that cannot be done manually. Make sure you understand your solution and it works for more than one case.
3. Optimize the manual steps. Figure out if there is an easier way to solve the problem or if there are steps you can cut out or simplify.
4. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code. This allows you to outline the structure of the code you're going to write. You might be able to skip this step if you created enough detail in your previous steps.
5. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code. This should be relatively easy if you've done the other steps.
6. Optimize the real code. Mainly simplify your code and get rid of duplication. This step may not be necessary.

_As much as 70% of your time should be spent in steps 1-3._

If you struggle writing the real code, there are two common reasons: 

1. You didn't break the problem down into small enough steps.
2. You don't know your programming language well enough to do the conversion.

To solve algorithm type problems in any language, you should know how to do the following things:

- Create a list
- Sort a list or array
- Create a map or dictionary
- Loop through a list or dictionary
- Parse strings
- Convert from string to int, int to string, etc.

For big problems, it may be helpful to "divide and conquer." In this case, you can try to cut the problem in half and then follow the process for each half.

#### Act like you make $1000/hr

[Act like you make $1000/hr](https://medium.com/swlh/pretend-your-time-is-worth-1-000-hour-and-youll-become-100x-more-productive-f04628bb3e6d)

Many people waste their time on pointless, low-quality activities that don't help them reach their true goals.

How would you spend your time differently if you placed a high value on it?

- What would your life look like?

- What people would you stop putting up with?

- What problems would you stop wasting time on?

- What things would you stop — and start — doing?

It takes discipline to not become "busy." You should be focused on what truly matters.

Busyness and stress are the enemy of success. Extremely successful people have crystal clear vision on their goals and do what they need to get there, every single day.

Do less. But do what you do with complete, hard focus.

If you don't manage your time, it will manage you.

You teach people how to treat you and how to value your time. Treat your time as a valuable commodity, and people will begin to treat it like that too.

You probably need to say "no" more. The world's most successful and extraordinary people say no to almost everything, but yes to a few things.


#### How to think like a programmer

[How to think like a programmer - lessons in problem solving](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/)


Thinking like a programmer is about a more effective way for problem solving.

Almost all employers prioritize problem-solving skills first.

The best way to solve problems involves having a framework and practicing it.

Steps:

1. Understand what's being asked. Make sure you can explain the problem in plain English.

2. Plan your solution. Give your brain time to analyze the problem and process the information. To get a good plan, answer this question: "Given input X, what are the steps necessary to return output Y?" Comments are a helpful tool for this.

3. Divide a big problem into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve. Solve them one by one starting with the simplest one. Another option is to reduce the problem to the point where you know how to solve it and write the solution. Then expand the problem slightly and rewrite the solution to match and keep going until you are back where you started.

4. If you're stuck, there are three things to try: debug, reassess, and research.

5. Practice - if you want to be a good problem-solver, solve lots of problems. Find something that allows you to solve many micro-problems. This could be playing a game or doing coding challenges. All problems share similar patterns.



#### The 5 Whys and Hows
[The 5 Whys and Hows](https://asq.org/quality-resources/five-whys)

The five whys and five hows techniques are a questioning process that is designed to drill down into the details of a problem or a solution and peel away the layers of symptoms. They allow you to get to the root cause or root solution.

The five whys are used for drilling down into a problem and the five hows are used to develop the details of a solution to a problem.

Steps:

1. Draw a box at the top of the paper or whiteboard. Inside the box, write down the problem or solution to be explored.
2. Below the statement box, draw five lines in descending order.
3. Ask "why" or "how" five times and write the answers on the lines from number 1 to 5.
4. It may take fewer or more than five times to reach the root cause or solution.
