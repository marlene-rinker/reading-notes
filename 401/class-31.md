### Hooks API

[Hooks API](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-31/DISCUSSION)


React hooks allow to to easily create and manage state in a functional component.

Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose additional rules:

-   Hooks must be named with a `use` prefix (i.e. `useFishingPole`)

-   -   Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions.

Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (You can also call Hooks from your own custom Hooks.)

**Built In Hooks**

`useState()` - returns a stateVariable and setterFunction for you to use to manage state in a functional component.

[Today's article](https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-javascript-guide/curriculum/class-31/DISCUSSION) has an example of how this works and the code for it.
