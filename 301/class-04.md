[CSS Grid Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows. 

You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element (which becomes the Grid Container) and to that element’s children (which become Grid Items).

Grid Container: The element on which display: grid is applied. It’s the direct parent of all the grid items.

Grid Item: The children (i.e. direct descendants) of the grid container.

This guide is a great resource to use when working with grids.
