### Mustache and Flexbox

[Templating with Mustache](https://medium.com/@1sherlynn/javascript-templating-language-and-engine-mustache-js-with-node-and-express-f4c2530e73b2)

Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. There are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.

[Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)

Flexbox layout tries to provide a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word “flex”).

Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the Grid layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

The parent is the flex container and the children are the flex items.
To define the flex container in CSS:

```
.container {
  display: flex; /* or inline-flex */
}
```

This article has a lot of examples and ways to format your web page using flexbox.
